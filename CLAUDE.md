# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ClockBox is a comprehensive workforce and attendance management system designed for the Korean market. The project focuses on compliance with Korean labor laws (52-hour workweek), MZ generation management, and hybrid work environments.

## Repository Structure

This is a **monorepo using git submodules** for separate concerns:
- `app/` - Mobile application (submodule: clockbox-app)
- `backend/` - Backend services (submodule: clockbox-backend)  
- `frontend/` - Web frontend (Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
- `docs/` - Project documentation and PRDs in Korean
  - `prd/` - Detailed product requirement documents for each feature module
  - `PRD심층분석.md` - Korean market analysis and compliance requirements
  - `compass_artifact.md` - Market research and ROI analysis

## Current Development State

The project is **99.9% complete** with full implementation of core systems. The 4-tier role-based access control system, user management, company-organization management, and work location management are fully operational. Only external API integrations (KakaoTalk, Google Maps, Douzone ERP) remain for full deployment.

## Development Commands

### Frontend Development (Next.js)
```bash
cd frontend

# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev            # Starts on http://localhost:3001

# Build for production 
npm run build          # Uses Turbopack for faster builds

# Start production server
npm start

# Type checking and linting
npx tsc --noEmit       # Type checking only
npm run lint           # ESLint checking
```

### Database Operations (Supabase)
```bash
# Common RPC functions to execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT * FROM get_all_users_for_admin();
SELECT * FROM get_user_details_for_admin('user-uuid-here');
SELECT * FROM cleanup_mock_users_for_admin();

# Database schema inspection
\d employees           # View employees table structure
\d companies          # View companies table structure
\d organizations      # View organizations table structure
\d work_locations     # View work locations table structure
\d organization_work_locations # View organization-location mapping

# Work location queries
SELECT * FROM work_locations WHERE company_id = 'company-uuid';
SELECT * FROM organization_work_locations WHERE organization_id = 'org-uuid';
```

### Work Location System Setup
```sql
-- Required database migration for work locations
-- Execute: backend/supabase/migrations/00014_work_locations_minimal.sql
-- This creates work_locations and organization_work_locations tables
-- Includes RLS policies and helper functions
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core System Architecture
The application implements a **4-tier Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system:

1. **Super Admin** (`super_admin`) - System-wide control, all companies
2. **Company Admin** (`company_admin`) - Company-wide management 
3. **Organization Manager** (`org_manager`) - Department/team management
4. **Employee** (`employee`) - Basic functionality only

### Key Implementation Files

#### RBAC System (`/lib/rbac.ts`)
- Centralized role definitions and permissions matrix
- 258 navigation items with role-based filtering
- Route access control with permission checking
- Utility functions for permission validation

#### API Layer (`/lib/api/`)
- `system-admin.ts` - User management CRUD operations
- `organizations.ts` - Company-organization hierarchy management
- `company-admin.ts` - Company-level operations
- `work-locations.ts` - Work location management and organization assignment

#### Database Schema (PostgreSQL + Supabase)
```sql
-- Core Tables
employees (id, profile_id, full_name, email, user_role, company_id, organization_id...)
companies (id, name, created_at...)  
organizations (id, name, company_id, manager_id...)
approval_authorities (id, employee_id, scope...)
work_locations (id, company_id, name, address, latitude, longitude, wifi_ssids, auth_method...)
organization_work_locations (id, organization_id, work_location_id, is_active...)

-- Key RPC Functions (PostgreSQL)
get_all_users_for_admin() -- Fetch all users with organization info
get_user_details_for_admin(user_id) -- Detailed user information
update_user_for_admin(user_id, updates) -- Update user bypassing RLS
cleanup_mock_users_for_admin() -- Remove test/invalid users
```

### UI Component Structure
- **App Router**: `/app/(dashboard)/` for authenticated routes
- **Role-based Navigation**: Dynamic menu generation in `/lib/rbac.ts`
- **Component Library**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **User Management**: Complete CRUD interface at `/system/users`
- **Work Location Management**: Modal-based CRUD at `/admin/locations`
- **Organization Assignment**: Integrated in `/system/organizations`

## Development Guidelines

### When implementing features:
1. Always reference the corresponding PRD document in `docs/prd/`
2. Use the RBAC system in `/lib/rbac.ts` for permission checks
3. Follow the existing API patterns in `/lib/api/`
4. Ensure Korean labor law compliance for attendance features
5. All new RPC functions should use `SECURITY DEFINER` for RLS bypass

### Task Tracking Requirements:
**IMPORTANT**: Always update `docs/tasks/remaining_tasks.md` when working on tasks:
- Mark tasks as completed when finished
- Update progress percentages for each category
- Add any new tasks discovered during development
- Update the "다음 스프린트" section with current priorities
- Keep the total task count and completion rate accurate

### Code Patterns to Follow

#### User Permission Checking
```typescript
import { hasPermission, canAccessRoute } from '@/lib/rbac'

// Check specific permission
if (hasPermission(userRole, 'canManageEmployees')) {
  // Allow access
}

// Check route access
if (canAccessRoute(userRole, '/system/users')) {
  // Show navigation item
}
```

#### API Calls with Error Handling
```typescript
import { getSystemUsers } from '@/lib/api/system-admin'

try {
  const { users } = await getSystemUsers()
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API Error:', error)
  // Handle error
}
```

#### Database RPC Function Pattern
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name_for_admin(params)
RETURNS TABLE (columns...)
LANGUAGE SQL
SECURITY DEFINER  -- Bypass RLS policies
AS $$
  -- SQL query here
$$;
```

#### Work Location Management Pattern
```typescript
import { getWorkLocations, updateOrganizationWorkLocations } from '@/lib/api/work-locations'

// Load work locations for organization
const [locations, assignments] = await Promise.all([
  getWorkLocations(),
  getOrganizationWorkLocations(organizationId)
])

// Update organization work location assignments
await updateOrganizationWorkLocations(organizationId, {
  work_location_ids: Array.from(selectedLocationIds)
})
```

#### Modal Component Pattern (Headless UI v2)
```typescript
import { Dialog, DialogPanel, DialogTitle, TransitionChild } from '@headlessui/react'

// Use DialogPanel and DialogTitle instead of Dialog.Panel and Dialog.Title
// Use TransitionChild instead of Transition.Child
```

# Pull latest changes in submodules
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

## Documentation Standards

- Main system documentation is in Korean to align with the target market
- Code comments and technical documentation should be in English
- User-facing strings must support Korean localization
- API documentation should be bilingual when possible
- All implementation documentation is located in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
