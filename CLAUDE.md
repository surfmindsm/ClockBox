# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the ClockBox project - a comprehensive workforce and attendance management system. The repository currently contains Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) in Korean, organized into a main specification and detailed feature specifications.

## Repository Structure

- `clockbox_main_prd.md` - Main PRD document containing overall product vision and feature areas
- `detailed_prd/` - Directory containing detailed PRDs for specific feature modules:
  - Account management (`prd_account.md`)
  - Organization/Branch management (`prd_org.md`)
  - Employee management (`prd_employee.md`)
  - Work scheduling (`prd_schedule.md`)
  - Attendance tracking (`prd_attendance.md`)
  - Leave management (`prd_leave.md`)
  - Request workflows (`prd_request.md`)
  - Reporting (`prd_report.md`)
  - Payroll (`prd_payroll.md`)
  - Messaging (`prd_message.md`)
  - Electronic contracts (`prd_contract.md`)
  - Company settings (`prd_company.md`)
  - Getting started guide (`prd_start.md`)

## Core System Features

The ClockBox system encompasses 13 main functional areas:
1. Onboarding and getting started
2. Account management
3. Organization/branch management
4. Role management
5. Employee management
6. Work scheduling
7. Attendance recording
8. Leave management
9. Request and approval workflows
10. Reporting and analytics
11. Payroll processing
12. Messaging and notifications
13. Electronic contract management

## Documentation Standards

- All PRDs are written in Korean
- The main PRD (`clockbox_main_prd.md`) serves as the master specification and should never be modified
- Feature-specific details are maintained in separate PRD files
- Documentation follows a structured format with clear sections for overview, user scenarios, feature definitions, and requirements

## Development Notes

This repository currently contains only specification documents. When implementing the actual system, refer to the PRD documents for:
- Feature requirements and user flows
- UI/UX specifications
- Business logic requirements
- Integration requirements
- Security and compliance requirements
